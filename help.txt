Welcome to Find My Seat!

The purpose of this simple program is to assist you in finding your room no. and exact seat for all of your exams.
This program does 2 simple things:
1. Connect to your Gmail to download latest seating plan.
2. Find your seat from the downloaded pdf.

If you refuse to connect to Gmail (in case you have the seating plan pdf file already downloaded), then you will be prompted to 
select path for the seating plan pdf.
If you accept to connect to your Gmail, then you will be prompted to enter your slate login credentials for the program to allow your download. it may take a few seconds.

Note: 
This is an individual project and I am looking forward to feedback from you guys. Kindly report any errors to me
